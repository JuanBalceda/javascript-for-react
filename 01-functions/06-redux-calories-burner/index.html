            <p>
                The book, Convert Anything to Calories, concluded that, on average, a person with an index finger
                measuring 10.8 cm ^ 3 and 11.7 grams will need a lot of clicks to keep the line. It takes 16.7
                micromoles of adenosine triphosphate (the molecule that transports energy between cells) to move one
                gram of the body for one second, and since there are 7.3 calories in one mole (the measure of quantity
                of a substance) of adenosine triphosphate, in theory , each mouse click should burn 1.42 calories.
                Although the calculation assumes the movement of the entire muscle, so the actual amount may vary
                slightly.

                But it turns out it's Saturday and you're hungry. thirty minutes later you get a pizza (1,835kCal) with
                a coke (97kCal), you would have to make 1,360,563 clicks to burn dinner. And since it is Saturday it
                will surely involve a few alcoholic drinks: in a Gin & Tonic (120kCal) there are 84,507 clicks, and
                131,690.14 for each beer you consume. In other words, with an average of 427 clicks per day, the
                computer is not a good exercise.
