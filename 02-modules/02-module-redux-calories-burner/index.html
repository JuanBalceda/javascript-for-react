                    The book, Convert Anything to Calories, concluded that, on average, a person with an index finger
                    measuring 10.8 cm ^ 3 and 11.7 grams will need a lot of clicks to keep the line. It takes 16.7
                    micromoles of adenosine triphosphate (the molecule that transports energy between cells) to move one
                    gram of the body for one second, and since there are 7.3 calories in one mole (the measure of
                    quantity
                    of a substance) of adenosine triphosphate, in theory , each mouse click should burn 1.42 calories.
                    Although the calculation assumes the movement of the entire muscle, so the actual amount may vary
                    slightly.

                    But it turns out it's Saturday and you're hungry. thirty minutes later you get a pizza (1,835kCal)
                    with
                    a coke (97kCal), you would have to make 1,360,563 clicks to burn dinner. And since it is Saturday it
                    will surely involve a few alcoholic drinks: in a Gin & Tonic (120kCal) there are 84,507 clicks, and
                    131,690.14 for each beer you consume. In other words, with an average of 427 clicks per day, the
                    computer is not a good exercise.
